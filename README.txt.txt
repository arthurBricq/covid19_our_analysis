COVID19-Analysis

This github is a very simple project that offers a template to analyse the virus situation in europe.We do not attribute any value to what is computed, it is only a visualisation tool that we developed. 

To make it work, one need to have access to the WHO database, accessible here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The folder hierarchy needs to be the following
-yourFolderName
	- CovidAnalysis: git clone of our project ()
	- COVID19: the git clone of the database (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Then the python code will run properly. Every time one wants to update the database, you need to 'git pull' the database folder (go to the folder in the terminal, type 'git pull')
